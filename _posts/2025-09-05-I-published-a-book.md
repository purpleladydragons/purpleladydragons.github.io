I published a book! It's called The Physiology of Climbing, and you can buy it on [amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Physiology-Climbing-Austin-Steady/dp/1954040199?crid=DQXNFZZT55SU&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.YSFQ0b0R1DemS6EZhMZSUX5xx4FrIAJUm7csVc9K2J3pL2LWfozld2tlh6_ciHF_q9RSK4BLZ8IO5QhtlAaCUS6Sw-BfIPZgyFP2BjFuX6fgB3-ZbB2c8NW9zf0PW0E21VpW63WNV0S7qCQFALyGd237CQN-8Tn7XVkJqDlOZ7oiZ0iUph5B4MgsqBk6i5vP.lwnYEwqRNaaExTAtc1wAyw46GeCrljOX3j-WqFXBu44&dib_tag=se&keywords=physiology+of+climbing&qid=1747174067&s=books&sprefix=physiology+of+climbin%2Cstripbooks%2C508&sr=1-1) 
or on my publisher's website [sharpendbooks.com](https://stores.sharpendbooks.com/the-physiology-of-climbing/).

I started the research for the book in June 2022 and finished the first draft in February 2023. After a few tweaks I submitted it for publication.
Life got busy for both me and my publisher, but the book eventually got published in February 2025. 

I am very proud to be able to say I wrote a book, especially one that was able to convince someone else to take a chance on me and publish it. 
I've received really incredibly nice emails from readers that have made me tear up.

I've spent much less time recently intensely focused on climbing as I was back in 2022, but I still have a few new things I would add to a second edition.
The research process itself led me to discovering open research questions that I would love to see answered. 

If you're interested in the book, but unsure about buying a copy just yet, please feel free to email me.
